### Project description

You can do IT - IT training & mentoring support project aims at empowering and upskilling clients to become more independent in using new technologies. The project will be a part of our weekly Job Club for clients referred by the Jobcentre Plus and for all other clients that require help with employability. Additionally we will offer one-to-one support sessions helping clients to gain skills such as: online application forms, email, typing, using help available online such as online translating tools. Our one-to-one sessions will cover: 
* Introduce and enhance IT skills - to be able to use the internet 
* Establish and Map Relevant skills motivation - knowing the reasons why using the internet is a good thing 
* Build awareness and confidence trust - a fear of online fraud, or not knowing where to start to go online

Job Club sessions 
Our training programme will be structured to deliver 8 training sessions to each participant over 2 months. On average, we accomodate 4 clients per session. We also take into account that some clients will need more flexible approach and more sessions will be available for clients needing extra support. 
1. We will run 2 hour long sessions a week initially then add 2 more as the numbers increase. The sessions timings will change to reflect clientsâ€™ needs. 
2. We will recruit and pay a sessional worker to deliver the training to both learners and mentors. 
3. We will be running a mentoring programme alongside the IT sessions to recruit learning mentors from our volunteers in the first place, and then open it up to all to plug any gaps in our language provision to match the needs of our clients. 
4. We will be paying for administative costs, cost of learner packs with additional information, marketing and promotion costs, and running costs such as paper/ink..etc 
5. We will be purchasing 5 new laptops and we already have secured software licences for the latest Microsoft Office package from TT-exchange.
